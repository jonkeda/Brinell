/// <b>Every row records what reached it, not merely that something did.</b> A status of
/// "Tapped x1" and a status of "Tapped x2" are different facts, and a test that can only see
/// "something happened" cannot tell a `Tap` that arrived once from one that arrived twice - which
/// is exactly the bug a gesture bridge is most likely to have.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>Commands, not event handlers.</b> <c>SendTapped</c>, <c>SendSwiped</c> and their relatives
/// are internal in MAUI 10, so a recognizer's event cannot be raised from outside the framework
/// and only its <c>Command</c> can. That is a constraint on the app under test as much as on the
/// bridge, and it is the reason every row here binds a command.
