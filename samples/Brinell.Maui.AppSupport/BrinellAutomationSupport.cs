/// <b>Why this is needed.</b> Stock MAUI layouts (<c>Grid</c>, the stack layouts,
/// <c>FlexLayout</c>, <c>AbsoluteLayout</c>) and content containers
/// (<c>ContentView</c>, <c>Border</c>) map to WinUI panels that have no
/// AutomationPeer. Their <c>AutomationId</c> is therefore invisible to UI Automation
/// — FlaUI, WinAppDriver, and Appium cannot see them at all. Any Brinell container
/// object targeting such a layout will fail to resolve, and the only symptom is an
/// <c>ElementNotFoundException</c> that looks exactly like a mistyped AutomationId.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>Two supported ways to use this.</b> Reference this project and call
/// <see cref="AddBrinellAutomationHandlers"/>, or copy the <c>Handlers</c> folder and
/// this file directly into the app under test. Both are expected: the app under test
/// is not always one you can add a project reference to.
