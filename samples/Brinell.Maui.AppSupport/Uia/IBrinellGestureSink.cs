/// <b>It owns the verbs it names.</b> Not "first refusal" - ownership. A sink that lists
/// <see cref="BrinellVerb.Pan"/> is what performs Pan on the elements it is attached to, and
/// there is no second opinion behind it. This is the change that stopped the dispatcher being a
/// ladder: the old interface returned <c>bool</c> from each method, meaning "I did not handle
/// this, carry on", which is a sentence only a ladder needs and an invitation to write its
/// <c>else</c>.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>Three verbs cannot be delivered any other way.</b> <c>Pan</c> and <c>Pinch</c> need MAUI
/// internals; <c>LongPress</c> has no MAUI recognizer at all. Without a sink the only remaining
/// route to any of them is a real pointer, which is the thing the background-mode work exists to
/// stop needing.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>Implement it on the control, on its view model, or on any object at all</b> - it is
/// attached with <see cref="GestureAutomation.SinkProperty"/> and does not have to be the
/// element itself.

/// Called on the UI thread, inside the bridge's timeout budget. Throwing is a failure and is
