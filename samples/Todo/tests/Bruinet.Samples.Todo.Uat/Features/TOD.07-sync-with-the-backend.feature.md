## Scenario: TOD.07.1 A sync fetches the users, pushes local changes, then pulls the server list

```gherkin
When I create a todo "Order paint"
And I sync
Then the sync should succeed with 1 pushed
And the server should have received, in order
  | Method | Resource |
  | ------ | -------- |
  | GET    | users    |
  | PUT    | todos    |
  | GET    | todos    |
And the todo "Order paint" should be synced
And the server should have todos
  | Title       |
  | ----------- |
  | Order paint |
```

## Scenario: TOD.07.2 After a successful sync the pending markers disappear

When I create a todo "Order paint"
Then I should be on the Todo List page
And the todo "Order paint" should be waiting to sync

Then the todo "Order paint" should be synced
And the server should have todos
