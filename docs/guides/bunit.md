# The bUnit Head

A Blazor suite can run its page objects, controls and feature files without a browser: bUnit
renders the app's components in the test process, and Bruinet drives them through the same
`IHtmlTestContext`. A run picks its head with `BRUINET_HEAD`; the browser stays the judge at every
gate. The decision is [AD-030](../../.docs/decisions/ad-030-a-blazor-suite-runs-without-a-browser.md).

## When To Use It

During development, to run the tests a change reaches in seconds. Bruinet's Blazor suite takes
2 s on bUnit and 39 s in a browser, with the same 35 tests; a call costs about 0.2 ms instead of
about 40 ms.

At a gate, run the browser head. bUnit has no layout, no style sheets and no script, so a page a
style sheet hides, or a handler bound in JavaScript, can pass on bUnit and fail in a browser.

## Running It

```bash
BRUINET_HEAD=bunit dotnet test testsnew/Bruinet.Blazor.UITests
```

Unset, or any value but `bunit`, is the browser. In PowerShell: `$env:BRUINET_HEAD = 'bunit'`.

## Giving A Suite A bUnit Head

1. Reference `Bruinet.Html.Bunit` and the app's project (its assembly, not only its build).
2. Make the context where the suite makes its browser context, by `WebHeads.IsBunit`:

```csharp
_context = WebHeads.IsBunit
    ? new BunitTestContext(new BunitTestContextOptions
    {
        RootComponent = typeof(Routes),        // the app's router, so pages open by address
        ConfigureServices = services =>         // the app's own services
        {
            services.AddScoped<IAuthService, AuthService>();
            services.AddSingleton<DataService>();
        },
    })
    : await BlazorTestContext.CreateAsync(options);
```

A suite on `HtmlTestFixtureBase` overrides `CreateBunitContext()` instead. Page objects and
scenarios need no change. Addresses are under `http://localhost`.

## What The Context Gives

| Option | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `RootComponent` | What is rendered: the app's `Routes`, or one component on its own |
| `ConfigureServices` | The app's services, registered before the root renders |
| `BaseUrl` | Where the context starts; empty is the root |
| `FallbackServices` | An app's own provider, asked for what the suite did not register (its in-process host's services); a scope of it per render of the root |
| `User`, `Roles` | Signed in through bUnit's test authorization; signed out by default; `SignIn` and `SignOut` while a test runs |
| `JsInterop`, `ConfigureJs` | Loose (every script call answered with a default) or Strict, and planned answers |

- **Sign-in:** the test authorization replaces the app's own provider, so arrange the account rather
  than signing in; Identity's sign-in pages are Razor Pages and do not render.
- **Readiness:** the context reads the layout's `bruinetBusy.set` calls, so `BlazorPageObjectBase`'s
  busy signal works as in a browser.
- **A "screenshot"** on this head is the rendered markup, saved as `.html`.
- **Results:** a scenario's `__result.json` says `"head": "bunit"`; the call log is `calls-bunit-….csv`.

## What Needs A Browser

Mark a test `[BrowserFact("why")]` (or `[UiFact(Browser = "why")]` for a `UiFact`) and a scenario `@browser`: on the bUnit head they are skipped with
the reason, so the run still lists them.

| Needs a browser | Why |
| --- | --- |
| Layout and style: `Location`, `Size`, `Rect`, `GetCssValue`, `ClickAt`, `Hover`, `Swipe` | No layout engine |
| Script: `Evaluate`, a handler bound in JavaScript | No JavaScript engine |
| Frames: `FrameScope` | An iframe is a document only a browser loads |
| Recordings and narrated videos | No pixels |
| XPath and accessible-name locators | Not supported; use a test id |

A browser-only member ends its call at once with `BrowserOnlyException` naming the member, rather than
waiting out the budget.

## What Behaves Differently

- **Visible** means no `hidden` attribute and no inline `display:none` or `visibility:hidden` on the
  element or its parents, not a hidden input, not folded in a closed `<details>` (its first `<summary>` shows),
  and not in a `<dialog>` without `open`. A class that hides through a style sheet still counts as visible;
  Blazor's error banner (`#blazor-error-ui`) never does.
- **Enabled** means no `disabled` attribute, and for a form control no disabled `<fieldset>` around it outside
  that fieldset's first `<legend>`.
- **`NavigateTo` is a page load**, as in a browser: a fresh root and scope, still signed in. A link clicked
  in the page navigates inside it; the app's own `NavigateTo(..., forceLoad: true)` is a page load too, on the
  next look at the page. A page load of an address no component serves (a Razor Page, an endpoint) ends the
  call with `BrowserOnlyException`.
- **History:** the page's `history.back()` goes back in its circuit, and an entry replaced (`replace: true`) is
  gone, as in a browser.
- **A click bubbles** through every handler around the element until one stops it (`@onclick:stopPropagation`),
  as bUnit raises it.
- **`Fill`** raises the input event where the element listens to one, then the change event; with
  `TextInputMethod.Keys`, `SendKeys` also raises key events per character.
- **A value the user entered** stays until a render changes that attribute, as Blazor's diff leaves the DOM,
  until the next action.
- **Click** runs the element's handler; a submit button without one submits its form; a link
  navigates after its handler, unless `@onclick:preventDefault` stops it. A disabled control gets no click.
- **A fold** (`<details>`) opens or closes on a click on its summary, or on the closed fold itself, and stays so
  until the page changes.
- **Check** on a radio sends its `value` (`on` without one), as a browser's change event does.
- **A handler that throws** ends the call with `AppUnavailableException`, as a browser's circuit ends;
  a throw after the handler's first `await` is reported on the next look at the page. An event on a handler
  a newer render dropped is a stale element, and the call looks again.

## A Whole App In Process

An app with a real composition (a database, workers) can be hosted in the test process with ASP.NET's
`WebApplicationFactory<T>` and given as `FallbackServices`. Register again in the context's own services any
scoped service that takes a circuit's service (`NavigationManager`), so it gets bUnit's. Tomorrow's studio suite
does this (`tests/Tomorrow.Studio.UITests/UiHost.cs` in that repository).

A host service that takes `NavigationManager`, `IJSRuntime` or `AuthenticationStateProvider` in its constructor and is
not registered again fails at once, naming the service and what it takes: from the host it would get services no
circuit initialized.
