# The Scraper

The Scraper records an app's pages into a UI test project and helps an agent (Copilot, Claude) make
page objects and controls from them. Html and Blazor apps today. The decisions are in
[AD-027](../../.docs/decisions/ad-027-the-scraper-records-into-the-project-and-calls-no-model.md).

## The view: eight steps

Open it in **VS Code** with **Brinell BDD: Open Scraper** (also on a `scraper.config.md`'s title bar),
in **Visual Studio** with View, Other Windows, **Scraper**. It is a workflow: the steps on the left,
each with its state (✓ done, its number to do, ! to look at) and a count, the step in the panel on
the right with one main button, and in the header **Next:** what to do now, with **Go**.

| Step | What it is for | Main button |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 Project | The UI test project the page objects go into | **New project…** (also **+** by the picker) |
| 2 Connect | Can the Scraper reach the app, signed in, and may Explore go there | **Check the app**; then **Allow this host** or **Open the browser to sign in** when it says so |
| 3 Collect pages | Explore's guards and budget as a form (**Save** writes the fields you changed, **Undo changes** puts them back), and the last run | **Explore** (a dry run the first time); **Record by hand** under More |
| 4 Review | The pages and their captures (an outline per capture, highlight, Compare, Changes), what Explore skipped by reason and the requests it blocked | none: **Next** |
| 5 Controls | **To make**: the patterns that repeat, each with a tick box and a control name; **Made**: the controls with a scraped header, checked against the recordings (each part found in how many of the pattern's occurrences) | **Make *n* controls with the agent**; per control **Review** (its code, its parts, a note, **Fix with the agent**, **Accept**). **Skip** if the page objects do without |
| 6 Page objects | A row per page: a tick box, its class name (edit it to rename the class, its draft and your part), and whether it is drafted or changed since | **Draft *n* page objects** (the ticked ones), **Improve with the agent** |
| 7 Verify | Each page object's members looked up in the running app | **Verify** |
| 8 Tests | Each test recording: its steps as the scenario says them, its gaps with why, its drafts (and whether the recording changed since) | **Record a test** (the browser opens with **Assert**, **Stop** and a count); per test **Draft** (as `## Tests` says, or xUnit, scenario, both) and **Run once** (built, then `dotnet test` on the draft) |

**Code**, below the steps, lists the project's page objects and controls. While a recording or
Explore runs, a strip under the header shows its progress with **Capture**, **Pick**, **Assert** (a test recording), **Stop**,
**Continue** (after a sign-in) and **This page…**. What the workflow remembers that the files do not
(the last check and verify, accepted controls, skipped controls) is in the project's
`.scraper-state.json`, which is not committed. An agent sees the same steps with
`get_scraper_progress`.

## Make a project scrapeable

A new project: **+** beside the Scraper's project picker. The form asks for the name, folder,
platform, start URL and test ids, and whether Brinell is referenced as projects (in this repository)
or as packages. It writes the `.csproj`, its `scraper.config.md` and an empty `Pages/`, and adds the
project to the open solution (in a solution folder, `Scraped` unless you name another). Each problem
shows under its field before anything is written. **Add a config to an existing project instead**
writes only the config into a test project you have. An agent does the same with
`create_scraped_project`.

The picker lists the solution's projects that have a `scraper.config.md`, and those under the
solution's folder; `TestResults` (the loop's copies) and build output are left out. Two projects of
one name are shown with their folders.

By hand: add `scraper.config.md` to the UI test project the page objects go into (one project per
app, or several for a large app; a project that references another scraped project sees its
controls):

```markdown
# Scraper Config

## App

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Platform | blazor |
| StartUrl | http://localhost:5180/ |
| Namespace | MyApp.UITests.PageObjects |
| Pages | PageObjects |
| Controls | PageObjects/Controls |
| Screenshots | false |

## Aliases

| Url |
| --- |
| https://myapp.example.be/ |

## Test ids

| Attribute |
| --- |
| data-testid |
| data-automation-id |

## Masks

| Pattern | Replacement |
| --- | --- |
| `NL\d{2}[A-Z]{4}\d{10}` | `IBAN` |

## Secrets

| Field | Placeholder |
| --- | --- |
| API key | |
| pin-code | pin |
```

- `Platform`: `html` or `blazor` (a Blazor project gets the `Brinell.Blazor` controls suggested).
- `Aliases`: other hosts of the same app; a page elsewhere (a sign-in provider) is not recorded.
- `Test ids`: the attributes that are test ids, preferred first.
- `Masks`: text replaced before anything is written. A page capture never records what a user typed;
  only a test recording's actions keep typed values, masked.
- `Secrets` (optional, columns `Field`, `Placeholder`): fields whose value a test recording never
  keeps, matched by test id, `name`, `id` or label text. The value stays in the browser; the action
  records `Placeholder` (default: the field in camel case, `apiKey`) for you to map to a setting or test
  data. A password field is always a secret, with the placeholder `password`.
- `Tests` (fields `Target`, `Base`): what a test recording is drafted as, `xunit`, `scenario` or
  `both`, and the test base an xUnit draft derives from (it gives `Context` and `NavigateToPage(path)`).
  A new config gets `Target`: `scenario` when the project has a `uat.config.md`, otherwise `xunit`.
  An xUnit draft goes to `Tests/Recorded/<Name>Tests.recorded.cs`, beside your part `<Name>Tests.cs`,
  which is written once and never changed; a scenario to `Features/Recorded/<name>.feature.md`. Each
  starts with what it was recorded from (`// <recorded session=… hash=… />`, or a `Recorded` metadata
  row), so a draft is drafted again over itself and never over a file you made.
- `Components` (optional, columns `Match`, `Kind`, `Name`): elements the Scraper cannot tell by itself, named by you. `Match` is `selector: …` or `text: …`; `Kind` is `collection`, `component` or what a test does with it (`text`, `selector`, `toggle`, `range`, `date`, `clickable`, `readable`). They win over its own reading: step 5 offers them by that name, and their brief says so.

`testsnew/Brinell.Blazor.UITests` is an example: its config, its `Recordings/`, and
`PageObjects/UserFormPage.cs`, made from them.

## Record

Step 3, More, **Record by hand** (or an agent's `start_recording`) opens a Chromium window. Work in it: each page the app moves to is captured once it has
settled (a hash route and `pushState` count as moves). **Capture** takes the page again (a dialog
open, a tab chosen); **Pick** lets you click an element to find it in the capture; **Stop** closes
the window. The window keeps its own login per project, under your local application data.

Recordings go to `Recordings/<date>-<session>/` in the project: `recording.json` and one
`*.nodes.jsonl` per page. Commit them: they are what the page objects were made from. The browser
is Playwright's Chromium (`pwsh <an Html test project's output>\playwright.ps1 install chromium`).

## Explore and draft

**Explore** visits the app's pages and states by itself and captures each new one as if you had
gone there: links to the app's own hosts, then tabs, menus, expanders, sorting, paging and dialogs
that say they are one. It works breadth first and stops at the first limit of its budget. Its
recording is `Recordings/<date>-explore/`, and everything else (patterns, suggestions, changes)
works on it as on yours. **Draft page objects** then writes a page object per recorded page, with
no model.

- **The view:** step 3 shows the guards and budget as a form and the summary of the run they make,
  with **Explore** (a dry run the first time: links only, it lists what it would click), **Stop**
  and **Continue** in the running strip. Step 4 lists what was captured, skipped and blocked, with
  **Never click**, **Always click** or **Allow this request**. Steps 6 and 7 draft and verify.
- **The command line** ([`brinell`](../run/cli.md), from the solution folder or a project's own
  folder, which picks the project):

  ```powershell
  brinell scrape status
  brinell scrape explore --project MyApp.UITests [--dry-run] [--max-pages N] [--max-depth N] [--max-minutes N] [--headless] [--yes] [--json]
  brinell scrape draft --project MyApp.UITests [--page /orders/{id}]
  brinell scrape verify --project MyApp.UITests [--headless]
  ```

  `explore` shows the guards and asks "Go on?" unless `--yes`; with no one at a terminal it does
  not start without `--yes`. It exits with 0 when it ran within its guards, 1 when a guard stopped
  it (a sign-in, a refused host), 2 for an error.
- **An agent:** `explore_app` (a dry run unless asked otherwise), `draft_page_objects`,
  `verify_page_objects` and `update_scraper_config`. Each asks you first.

**Signing in is yours.** Explore uses the project's browser profile. When it reaches a sign-in page
(the config's `LoginUrl`, a page with a password field it was sent to, or another host), it stops
and asks you to sign in in the window. It never types.

**The guards** are settings in `scraper.config.md`. The defaults are the careful ones; loosen what
you know is harmless for your app and tenant:

```markdown
## Explore

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| MaxPages | 50 |
| MaxDepth | 4 |
| MaxMinutes | 10 |
| DelayMs | 500 |
| LoginUrl | /login |
| Within | |
| ClickPolicy | safe |
| BlockMethods | POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE |
| WebsocketApps | links |

## Danger words

| Category | On |
| --- | --- |
| delete | false |

## Explore hosts

| Host |
| --- |
| localhost |
| test.myapp.example |

## Never click

| Match |
| --- |
| text: Empty cache |
| selector: [data-testid=danger-zone] button |

## Always click

| Match |
| --- |
| selector: [data-testid=filter-toggle] |

## Never visit

| Url |
| --- |
| /admin |

## Allow requests

| Method | Url |
| --- | --- |
| POST | /graphql |
```

| Setting | What it decides |
| --- | --- |
| `ClickPolicy` | `links`; `safe` (the default: links, tabs, menus, expanders, sorting, paging, dialogs); `not-unsafe` (also buttons it cannot place); `all` (submits too: a throwaway environment only, asked twice, and only on a host named in `Explore hosts`) |
| `Danger words` | categories of words that make an element unsafe, all on by default, in English, Dutch, German and French: `sign-out`, `delete`, `update`, `send`, `pay`, `approve`, `bulk`. Turn one off by name |
| `BlockMethods` | request methods aborted while exploring; `GET`, `HEAD` and `OPTIONS` always go through. `Allow requests` lets single endpoints through |
| `WebsocketApps` | a page that opens a websocket (Blazor Server, SignalR) clicks without a request the guard can see: `links` (the default) explores its links only, `warn` explores it anyway, `ignore` does not say so |
| `Within` | a path, or `/#/route`, the links Explore visits stay under: `/components/tabs` keeps it on that page and its states. Empty: the whole app |
| `Explore hosts` | where Explore may run: `localhost` and `127.0.0.1`, and every other host by name |

After every click it checks it is still on the app's host, still signed in, with no dialog it did
not open and no download; otherwise it stops and says after which click. The report,
`explore.md` in the session, lists each capture and the click that led to it, each element skipped
and why, and each request blocked.

**A draft** is `Pages/<Name>.scraped.cs`, a `partial` class made from the page as it opens: a member
per element with a stable locator, named from its test id or text. What has no stable locator, and
what only a click shows, is listed in a comment at the end. Put your own members in the other part,
`Pages/<Name>.cs`. Drafting again replaces only the `.scraped.cs`. A page with a page object you
made by hand is not drafted. A draft that does not build is put back and reported, and so is one
that drops a member your part uses. Controls are not drafted: Draft lists the parts that repeat,
and **Improve with the agent** makes them. **Verify** opens each page in the running app and finds
every member's locator: once, several times, or not at all.

## Generate

The view's agent buttons (step 5's **Make *n* controls** and **Fix with the agent**, step 6's **Improve with the agent**, a node's **Make a control**) send a prompt
into Copilot Chat, in the agent and with the model chosen in the header (**Agent and model**). The
**Brinell scraper** agent (`.github/agents/brinell-scraper.agent.md`) has the Brinell tools and the
rules; **Agent** and **Ask** get them from the `/brinell-scrape-pages` prompt. A control is made from
its brief (`control_brief`), at most five per prompt. When the IDE cannot send it, the prompt goes to
the clipboard and the view says so. When the answer is complete, step 5 or 6 checks again by itself.
Visual Studio sends it into the open chat session with the chosen model, in the chat window's own
mode. Review the result in your usual diff.

Your choice is kept per project in `.scraper-state.json`; `## Agent` in the config gives the default:

```
## Agent

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Agent | brinell-scraper |
| Model | gpt-4.1 |
```

Register the MCP server as in [Copilot And Other Agents](visual-studio-preview.md#copilot-and-other-agents).
Its Scraper tools:

| Tool | Gives or does |
| --- | --- |
| `list_scraped_projects` | the projects with a `scraper.config.md` |
| `get_scraper_progress` | where a project is in the workflow: each step's state and what to do next |
| `start_recording`, `capture_page`, `stop_recording` | a recording (one at a time per server) |
| `list_recorded_pages` | pages by key (path and hash route, ids as `{id}`), their captures, the page object made for each and whether the page changed since |
| `get_page_snapshot` | a capture as an outline with node numbers; a node's subtree for a large page |
| `find_similar_elements`, `search_recordings` | where a kind of node, or a text, occurs |
| `detect_patterns` | repeated parts (controls to make) and forms, tables, lists, navigation, dialogs, frames |
| `control_brief` | everything known about a pattern to make a control from it: where to write it and what to read, its occurrences, an example outline, its parts with how often each is found, and hints (what the elements are, a base, members) |
| `list_controls`, `match_controls` | the project's page objects and controls, and which occur on a page |
| `suggest_controls` | per element: a name, the control that fits, and a locator (test id, accessible name or text, stable id, stable class; a position last, marked unstable) |
| `scraped_header` | the first line of a generated file: what it was made from |
| `write_code`, `check_code` | write a file into the project (syntax checked first), then build it |
| `diff_page` | what changed on a page since its page object was made |
| `explore_app` | Explore, a dry run unless asked; asks first |
| `draft_page_objects`, `verify_page_objects` | Draft and Verify, for all pages or one |
| `update_scraper_config` | one row or field of `scraper.config.md` changed; asks first |
| `create_scraped_project` | a new scraped project (its `.csproj`, config and `Pages/`), not yet in the solution; asks first |

## When the app changes

Steps 3, 6 and 7 get a **!** and the header says what to do: explore or record the page again, then
update its page object. In step 4 a page whose page object was made from an older capture is marked;
**Changes** (or `diff_page`) lists what was added, removed and changed since, and **Update page
object** asks the agent to change only that.

## The loop

`tools/Scripts/scrape-loop.ps1` runs everything end to end, unattended, and writes one report. Run
it after changing the Scraper (from the Brinell root):

```powershell
pwsh tools/Scripts/scrape-loop.ps1 -Target test-site
pwsh tools/Scripts/scrape-loop.ps1 -Target test-site -Profile test-tenant -Repeat 3
pwsh tools/Scripts/scrape-loop.ps1 -Target blazor-sample
pwsh tools/Scripts/scrape-loop.ps1 -Target test-site -Agent copilot
pwsh tools/Scripts/scrape-loop.ps1 -Target sites -Agent none
```

The targets: `test-site` and `blazor-sample` run locally. `plain`, `react`, `vue2` and `blazor` are
one public page each (the-internet, DemoQA, Element UI, MudBlazor), from the projects in
[Scraper.Sites](../../Scraper.Sites/README.md), and `sites` runs the four with one summary. A public
site that does not answer is reported as site down, not a failure. It has no counters, so its
Guards stage checks every clicked element's label against the danger words, outside Explore's
judge.

| Stage | Does | Fails when |
| --- | --- | --- |
| App | starts the target on a free port: the Scraper's test site (`testsnew/Brinell.Scraper.TestSite`, with a page of dangerous controls that count each hit) or the Blazor sample | it does not answer |
| Explore | `scrape explore --headless --yes` with the profile's guards | a guard stopped it unexpectedly, or it found fewer pages than the target has |
| Guards | reads the test site's counters | `careful`: any counter moved. `test-tenant`: anything but delete and update moved, or those were not reached |
| Draft | `scrape draft` | a draft does not build |
| Agent | Copilot CLI or Claude Code with only the Brinell MCP server's tools, to make controls and better names; Copilot CLI by default; skipped for `-Agent none` | `check_code` fails, or it ran past `-AgentMinutes` |
| Verify | `scrape verify` | a member is not found, or found more than once. A member of the project's own control (`new(this, "Elements")`) is not read: its control makes its locator |

Each run works on a new project under `TestResults/scrape-loop/<date>-<target>/`, never on the
repository, and writes `loop-report.md` and `loop-report.json` there even when a stage fails.
`-WebsocketApps` overrides the Blazor sample's `warn`. `-TurnOff <category>` turns a danger word off
while the guard check still expects the profile, to prove the loop catches a broken guard. The
agent stage costs the CLI's credits; `-Agent none` runs the loop without it.
