/// <b>Focus is the linchpin of the whole programme.</b> Every physical action in the driver
/// calls <c>SetForeground</c> first, and its own remarks admit why: without it, keystrokes meant
/// for the app land in whatever the person at the keyboard is doing. Foreground is a
/// desktop-global resource and there is exactly one of it; <c>VisualElement.Focus</c> is not,
/// and costs nobody anything.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>How these tests prove it, and why the proof is unusual.</b> Asserting that focus landed
/// says nothing about how - the old path would pass the same assertion, having stolen the
/// foreground on the way. So each test runs inside
/// <see cref="PhysicalInputPolicy.Refused"/>, which turns every real mouse, keyboard,
/// clipboard and <c>SetForeground</c> call in the framework into a
/// <see cref="PhysicalInputRefusedException"/>. A test that passes under it did not touch any of
/// them: not because it was measured afterwards, but because the alternative would have thrown.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The foreground assertions are then belt and braces, and cheap enough to keep - they name the
/// symptom a person would actually notice.
