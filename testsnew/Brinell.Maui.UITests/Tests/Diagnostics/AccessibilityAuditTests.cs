/// switch device. Instrumenting an element should be the moment somebody asks whether it is
/// gesture-<i>only</i>. This is the list that asks, written to

/// and never will be: the sample app contains gesture-only controls on purpose, because they are
/// what the bridge exists to reach. Asserting emptiness would fail forever and teach everyone to
/// ignore it. What is asserted is that the audit still tells the four cases apart - a control
/// nothing but a pointer reaches, one no accessibility tree contains, one with a keyboard route,
/// and an element that only answers reads. Those are the classifications the report's value rests
/// on, and each is pinned to a named element that would notice if MAUI's tree changed underneath
/// it.

/// unload, so the audit sees one page at a time. This walks the pages that declare verbs and

/// reading the artifact: a short backlog can mean a healthy app or a short walk.
