# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- `BRINELL_TIMEOUT_SCALE`: a factor (0.1 to 20) on the waits a call takes from `TimeoutSettings`
  (`DefaultWait`, `PageLoad`, `ElementFind`, `ElementState`), for a slow or shared machine; a
  `timeoutMs` a test passes is not scaled.
- `near-misses.md` in the suite's artifact folder (`NearMisses`): every call of the run that
  passed after trouble, worst first, written when one happens, with no switch. A call that used
  more than its budget's share in a single attempt now counts as a near-miss too (a Playwright
  action that waited inside itself), where only a call of several attempts did.
- A failing Html UAT scenario leaves a screenshot: `PlaywrightTestContext` is an
  `IScreenshotSource` (PNGs in the run's `suites/<suite>/screenshots`), and
  `UatScenarioResults.ScreenshotServiceOf` finds one on the fixture or on its public properties
  (a fixture's `Context`), so a suite gets it without code of its own. `ScreenshotService` takes
  any way of saving one (`Action<string>`). Under `dotnet test` the suite folder is named after the
  test assembly, not `testhost`.
- Predicate waits: `WaitAttribute(name, until)` on every Html, MAUI and native Android control, and
  `WaitText(until)` on Html's and native Android's (a MAUI control's text is its own). One call
  within the budget, polled as `WaitText(expected)` is; when the predicate never held, the call
  answers false and its log exit names the last value read. For a state a page object waited for
  in a loop of its own (a count above zero, a value that changed).
- `AfterScenario` on `UatScenarioTestBase` and `IUatScenarioLifecycle` (a no-op by default): runs after
  each scenario, passed or failed, once its recording is finished, so a suite whose scenarios share
  a fixture with other tests can put back what a scenario changed (sign out) without it showing in
  the video. The IDE runner host calls it when it closes a scenario. When the scenario failed or
  was canceled, its own failure is reported and a failing `AfterScenario` is only traced; the host
  then ends the fixture rather than keeping it.
- `Brinell.NativeAndroid` in MAUI's and Html's shape (AD-010, AD-013, `docs/platform-guides/native-android.md`):
  its own `INativeAndroid*` interfaces; the Core calls layer (act once, confirm, one log pair); scope
  readiness (the app in front, the page's activity and ready view, the `brinell_busy` busy view);
  generated controls with Android's widget names (`EditText`, `Spinner`, `RecyclerView`, `RatingBar`,
  `TabLayout`, `AlertDialog`, `PermissionDialog`, ...); collections whose rows follow their item
  when a `RecyclerView` recycles; scroll-to-find with `UiScrollable`; named, element-relative
  gestures. `tools/Scripts/CreateNativeAndroid.Bat` generates the controls. The breaking change is
  total: the old hand-written classes (`NativeAndroidControl`, `NativeAndroidPageObjectBase`, the
  MAUI-named controls) are gone; nothing in the repository used them.
- `Brinell.Appium` (AD-026 R4): Appium's error mapping (now public, with `IsUnknownCommand` and
  `IsNoAnswer`), `AndroidHost` and `AndroidRecorder`, moved out of `Brinell.Maui.Appium` so the
  MAUI and native Android stacks share them. `Brinell.Appium.Tests` took their tests.
- `samples/Brinell.Samples.NativeAndroid.App`, a .NET for Android control gallery, and
  `testsnew/Brinell.NativeAndroid.UITests` (30 UI tests and UAT scenarios on the emulator,
  `docs/run/native-android.md`); the `android-control` and `android-ui-test` skills.
- UAT finds a control by Core's `IElementObject<>` as well as by its name's suffix, and no longer
  takes a page's `Self` for a control.
- One command line, `brinell` (AD-028, `docs/run/cli.md`): a dotnet tool (`Brinell.Cli`) with
  `scrape` (`new`, `list`, `status`, `check`, `explore`, `record`, `draft`, `verify`, `config`,
  `install-browser`), `data` (what `brinell-data` did), `scenario` (`preview`, `results delete`),
  `controls generate` (what `Brinell.Generator` did), `version`, and the servers `lsp` and `mcp`.
  One set of options (`--solution`, `--project`, `--json`, `--yes`, `--headless`) and exit codes
  (0 fine, 1 problems found, 2 could not run). `tools/Brinell.Bdd.LanguageServer` is now
  `tools/Brinell.Cli` (assembly `brinell`); `tools/Brinell.DataValidator` and `tools/Brinell.Generator`
  are folders of it, and their tests are in `testsnew/Brinell.Cli.Tests`. The IDE extensions start
  `brinell.dll lsp`; `brinell-data`, `--mcp` and `--preview` are gone. `tools/Scripts/brinell.ps1`
  runs it from source.
- The Scraper, restarted in the IDE extensions (AD-027, `docs/guides/scraper.md`): `Brinell.Scraper`
  records an app's pages through Playwright's Chromium into the UI test project
  (`scraper.config.md`, `Recordings/`), finds repeated parts, suggests controls and locators, diffs
  captures, writes code and builds it. The language server serves it to a Scraper view in VS Code and
  Visual Studio and to agents as MCP tools; the `scrape-pages` skill and `/brinell-scrape-pages`
  prompt say how. `Brinell.Core.Scraping` holds `IScrapeSource` and the snapshot model. The WPF
  Scraper (`tools/Brinell.Scraper`), its per-user SQLite corpus and its Copilot SDK calls are removed.
- Packaging of the IDE extensions: a release attaches the Visual Studio VSIX and the VS Code VSIX,
  each with the language server inside and stamped with the tag's version. CI builds both on
  every pull request (`ide-extensions`). The server warns on the suite config (`UATG010`) when the
  suite's build references a Brinell assembly at another major or minor version than its own
  (`BddVersionCheck`, `BddSuite.VersionMismatches`).
- Debugging the app too: while a debugger is attached to a test, `DebuggedApps.Announce`
  (`Brinell.Core.Diagnostics`) writes each app the test starts to
  `%TEMP%\Brinell\debugged-apps\<test pid>-<app pid>.json`. The MAUI FlaUI driver and the web host
  announce theirs; the web host skips `dotnet run`, whose process is the CLI. A Debug from the
  Visual Studio preview or from VS Code's Test Explorer attaches to each announced app after the
  testhost, so a breakpoint in the app's own code stops too.
- The VS Code extension (`tools/Brinell.Bdd.VsCode`, TypeScript):
  - an LSP client for feature, step and config files on the same language server;
  - the same Scenario Preview in a webview, its screenshots through the webview's own URIs;
  - Test Explorer on the scenarios' addresses: build, then `dotnet test --filter BddScenario=...`,
    results from the reports, and Debug attaching the C# debugger to the testhost;
  - step breakpoints in the file Visual Studio uses, with gutter dots.
  The server gains `brinell/scenarios` (each suite's tests and filters) and `brinell/lastRuns`
  (a file's last results with the failed step).
- The Brinell MCP server, for Copilot's agent mode and other agents:
  `Brinell.Bdd.LanguageServer --mcp [--solution <folder>]` (`BddMcpServer`), over stdio. It has the
  tools `list_suites`, `list_steps` (by words), `list_pages`, `list_test_sets`, `validate_scenario`
  (a draft checked with the gate's words) and `find_step_usages`. It calls no model. The prompt
  file `.github/prompts/brinell-write-scenario.prompt.md` writes a feature file with them, using
  only the suite's steps. The Scraper's corpus tools (`scraper-in-extension.md`) are not part of it:
  that proposal waits for its owner.
- Config and data files in the editor: `uat.config.md` and `bdd.config.md` get diagnostics (`UATG001`-`UATG009`)
  for what the suite would ignore or reject:
  - an unknown section, field or assembly kind, and a Runtime table without a Fixture;
  - a head, boolean, test set or app row that is not valid, and a missing AppsFile;
  - an assembly not built yet, a `Using` namespace nothing is in, and a suite that cannot bind;
  - a `testdata.schema.json` out of date with its definition, which a quick fix regenerates as
    `brinell-data schema` would.
  Completion and hover cover the fields, their values (heads, booleans, test sets), the assembly
  kinds, the namespaces and the apps' heads. A feature file's `TestData` metadata offers the test
  sets. `BddSuite.TestDataDefinitions` loads the suite's test-data definitions with its build, each
  placed at its project rather than in the shadow copy.
- BDD Explorer (Visual Studio, **View > Other Windows > BDD Explorer**) shows three views of a suite,
  and any entry with a source opens it:
  - **Steps**: the steps grouped by their class, page, control verbs and built-ins, then the
    callable steps by step file, and the hooks of each step-definition class with their tags;
  - **Pages**: each page with its controls (type, where tapping goes) and its page phrases;
  - **Results**: the last run of each scenario.
  The language server renders them (`brinell/explorerHost`, `brinell/explorer`), and the window
  refreshes after a build and when a run writes results.
- Quick fixes and refactorings in the editor (`textDocument/codeAction`, `prepareRename`, `rename`):
  - a value with one right answer is rewritten, as `brinell-data validate --fix` does;
  - old headings are rewritten, and an old file name is renamed (UAT029) when the client can
    rename files;
  - **Create step definition** for a step that binds to nothing puts a stub, with its phrase and a
    placeholder per quoted value and number, into the suite's `[BddStepDefinitions]` class;
  - **Extract** turns selected steps into a `## Step:` of the file with a call in their place;
  - **Inline** puts a call's body in its place, with the call's values;
  - **Rename** a callable step renames its heading and every call, each call keeping its values.
    A new phrase that drops a placeholder is refused.
  `BddSuite.StepDefinitionTypes` lists the loaded suite's step-definition classes.
- CodeLens from C# to scenarios (Visual Studio): "used in N BDD steps · M scenarios" above step
  definitions, page phrases and page-object controls, with the steps in its details.
  `brinell/usages` in the language server counts across every suite. A new assembly,
  `Brinell.Bdd.VisualStudio.CodeLens`, runs in Visual Studio's CodeLens process and reaches the
  server through the extension's `ICodeLensCallbackListener`.
- Hover, go to definition and find references in the editor (`Brinell.Bdd.LanguageServer`). Hover
  shows what a step binds to, its page and app, the method's XML `<summary>`, and each argument as
  written and as read. A call shows the callable and its body. Definition opens a C# step's method
  through the portable PDB (`BddSourceLocator` in `Brinell.Bdd.Workspace`, which also reads a PDB
  beside a renamed assembly), a control verb's control on the page at that line, a page step's page
  class, and a call's `## Step:` heading. References finds every step in the suite's feature files,
  linked files included, that binds to the same method or calls the same callable.
  `BddSuite.FindType` finds a type of the loaded suite, and the shadow copy now takes the XML doc
  files too.
- Completion in the editor (`textDocument/completion`): keywords, sections, and step texts by
  words (every typed word in the phrase, not only a prefix) as snippets with `{x}` tab stops. The
  current page's steps come first, and the file's callable steps are included. The values of the
  parameter at the caret are offered too: pages, the controls of the page the binder has the
  scenario on at that line, users, apps, enum members, and an outline's Examples columns.
- Outline, folding and semantic colours in the editor (`Brinell.Bdd.LanguageServer`):
  `textDocument/documentSymbol` gives the heading tree by kind, `foldingRange` folds the sections,
  fences, tables and doc strings, and `semanticTokens/full` colours keywords, quoted values, `{x}`
  and `<x>` placeholders, tags and comments. They come from the file's shape (`BddDocumentStructure`),
  so they work before a build and while the file does not parse.
- Diagnostics in the editor (Visual Studio, `Brinell.Bdd.LanguageServer`): feature, step and config
  files get the `brinell-bdd` content type (derived from Markdown) and an LSP client. The server
  publishes the gate's diagnostics word for word: the open file after a pause in typing, and every
  file of its suites on save and after a build. A step that failed in the last run is a `UATRUN`
  error at its line. `BddFileAnalysis` (`Brinell.Bdd.Preview`) is the one check the preview and the
  server share. The server only computes diagnostics for a client that declares it takes them.
- Debug from the preview (Visual Studio): **Debug** beside each **Run** and **Debug file** beside
  **Run file** run with `VSTEST_HOST_DEBUG` and attach Visual Studio's debugger to the testhost; a
  failed attach cancels the run. Step breakpoints are toggled by clicking a step's keyword in the
  preview, or with **Toggle BDD Step Breakpoint** (editor context menu, **Ctrl+K, F9**) on a step
  line. Either way they are written to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Brinell\bdd-breakpoints.json`, and a red dot
  shows in the preview's gutter and in the editor's glyph margin. Breakpoints move with their lines
  as the file is edited.
- Run from the preview (Visual Studio): **Run** on each scenario heading and **Run file** on the title
  build the solution, then run `dotnet test --no-build --filter BddScenario=<address>` with the output
  in the Output pane. One run at a time; a build started during a run is cancelled; **Cancel run**
  stops the test process tree. `brinell/runTarget` gives the project and filter; a suite whose test
  class keeps `[Theory]` shows the buttons disabled, saying why (`BddSuite.HasScenarioTheory`).
- Step breakpoints (`Brinell.Bdd`): while a debugger is attached, `BddStepExecutionSession.RunNextAsync`
  stops before a step whose line `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Brinell\bdd-breakpoints.json` lists, with a
  `BddStepBreak` local (text, arguments, app, page, call chain); a line in a `.steps.md` stops at each
  call, a call's line once before its first step, and `breakOnFailure` after a failed step. The
  check is behind `IBddBreakHook` (`BddExecutionContext.Breaks`); without a debugger nothing is read.
- `[UatScenarioTheory]` (`Brinell.Uat`): `[Theory]` with a stable address per scenario, the `BddScenario`
  trait `<file relative to the config>#<slug>` (`BddScenarioAddress` in `Brinell.Bdd`), so
  `dotnet test --filter "BddScenario=..."` runs one scenario. A case whose feature file is the
  project's own has the scenario's line as its source. The Todo MAUI, web, mixed and service suites
  use it; their cases and counts are unchanged.
- `Brinell.Bdd.Workspace` (tools/): loads a suite one way for every tool. It finds the suites (projects
  with a `uat.config.md` or `bdd.config.md`), reads the config, knows which suites a feature file
  is linked into, and builds the catalogs from a shadow copy of the build output in a collectible
  load context, so a build never meets a locked file and `Reload` releases the old build.
  `brinell-data` loads suites through it; its output is unchanged.
- `Brinell.Bdd.Preview` (tools/): renders a feature or step file as HTML for the IDE preview, from the
  engine's parse: steps with the keyword in a gutter, quoted values, `{x}` arguments and `<x>`
  placeholders marked, tables and doc strings, tags, the metadata table, `## Step:` sections, and
  each parse diagnostic at its line (UAT029 with its fix for the old forms). Markdig renders the
  Markdown around, with raw HTML off; every block has `data-line`. The stylesheet's colours are
  CSS variables with light, dark and high-contrast values.
  With the suite's catalogs it binds the file (unsaved text too) with the gate's own check: each
  step says what it binds to and on which page, the page shows where it changes, a step that binds
  to nothing shows the gate's diagnostic word for word, a callable call unfolds into its body with
  the values filled in, and each Scenario Outline row can be opened. `Brinell.Bdd` gains
  `BddScenarioFiles.Load(path, text)`, `ParsePhrases(path, text)`, `CheckPhrases` and
  `BddLoadedScenarioFile.Check` (the gate's per-file check, which `UatScenarioCheck` now calls), and
  `BddBindResult.Scenarios`: every scenario as far as it bound, errors or not.
- `Brinell.Bdd.LanguageServer` (tools/): the one .NET process the IDEs talk to, JSON-RPC over stdio with
  LSP framing (StreamJsonRpc). It serves `initialize` (the suites under the solution), full-text
  document sync, `brinell/preview` (the file rendered, bound in its suite or parsed only with the
  reason; a file linked into several suites offers each) and `brinell/buildDone` (reload the
  catalogs). `--preview <file> --out <page.html>` renders one file as a page without an IDE.
- `Brinell.Bdd.VisualStudio` (tools/, its own `.slnx`, built with Visual Studio's MSBuild): the Scenario
  Preview tool window for Visual Studio 2022 17.10+ and 2026. A WebView2 shows the language
  server's preview of the active feature or step file; it renders again after a pause in typing and
  after each build, keeps the caret and the preview in step both ways, follows the VS theme, and
  offers a suite picker for a linked file. **Ctrl+K, V** opens it. The VSIX carries the server.
  `BddPreview.HostPage` is the webview's page (the same for VS Code) and `brinell/previewHost`
  serves it. Guide: "Scenario Preview In Visual Studio".
- UAT reports name their file, lines and steps: `__result.json` is named after the feature file and the
  scenario (two files with a scenario of the same name no longer share one), and always holds the
  file, the scenario's line, the duration, and each step's line, status and message (`callLine` for
  a callable's step). The binding, catalog and discovery stay behind `IncludeRuntimeTrace`. The
  manifest record gains `suite`, `file` and `line`. The preview shows the newest run of each
  scenario: step statuses with text alternatives, the scenario's result and duration, a failed
  step's message and screenshot; the server finds it through the manifests and sends
  `brinell/resultsChanged` when a run writes one.
- Docs: AD-020 (a tier is a head: `service`, opt-in heads, UATB013, a scenario counts for each of
  its tiers) and AD-021 (`Brinell.Bdd` under `Brinell.Uat`), with their invariants; the guide
  "Features Below The UI". AD-011, AD-014, AD-017 and AD-019 use the new words and file names.
- Hooks on step-definition classes (`Brinell.Bdd`): `[BddBeforeFeature]` (static, once per feature
  file per run), `[BddBeforeScenario(tags)]`, `[BddAfterScenario(tags)]` and `[BddAfterStep(tags)]`,
  after the test base's own overrides and in class and method order.
- `BddSets.AssertSet(expected, actual, ordered)`: one diff for two lists (missing, extra, the closest
  item's different cells). The server-order step uses it. `BddStepDefinitionRuntime.FromTypes` and
  `CreateCommandCatalog` build a catalog of step-definition classes without pages.
- Todo sample: UI tests and UAT scenarios for users (TOD.11): `UserListPage`, `UserEditPage` and
  `UserList` in the `Users` namespace, `UsersJourneyTests` (8), `TOD.11-manage-users.uat.md`
  (8 scenarios with `Using | Users`), and an expected-failure file without the `Using` that must
  fail binding. The user form's date and time pickers publish `SetDate` and `SetTime` through the
  gesture bridge. `true`/`false` values may be written `on`/`off`.
- UAT `Using` (AD-019): a scenario file's `Using` metadata row and the config's `## Using` table
  name the namespaces a file sees besides its folder's. A `Using` that names nothing is `UATB011`;
  one no step needs is a `UATB012` warning. Pages have namespaces too (`[UatNamespace]` on the page
  class or assembly, now in `Brinell.Core.Testing` and allowed on a class): one name in two
  namespaces is two pages, a step names the one it sees, or `Accounts/Detail` when it sees both.
  A failure report names each step's scope (`[Invoicing]`, `[page Todo List]`);
  `brinell-data phrases <file>` lists only what that file sees, by namespace, and
  `brinell-data references <namespace>` lists who uses one. The Todo suites put their backend,
  device, app-lifecycle and stored-data phrases in namespaces, used by every file through
  `## Using`.
- UAT folder namespaces: a folder under `Scenarios/` is a namespace, and a scenario sees the
  phrases of its own folder and the folders above it. `*.phrases.md` files may sit in any folder
  (copy them with `Scenarios\**\*.phrases.md`); `[UatPhraseClass(Namespace = "Invoicing")]` and
  `[assembly: UatNamespace("Invoicing")]` put a C# phrase class in one. A callable's body binds
  where it is written. A step that matches only another folder's phrases is `UATB010`, naming the
  folder; a phrase of the folder and a wider one for one step are ambiguous. `brinell-data`
  checks phrase files in subfolders and lists each phrase's namespace.
- UAT page scope: control verbs and page phrases bind against the current page, which the binder
  follows through the steps before running (the page a step names, a returned page object,
  `[UatNavigatesTo]` on a control, a callable's steps). A missing control, a verb the control
  lacks, or a page phrase of another page is now a bind error (`UATB009`) instead of a run
  failure; a page-scoped step with no known page is `UATB008`, naming the step that may have left
  it. A phrase of the page that also matches a wider phrase is ambiguous (`UATB002`).
  `Navigates` on `[UatWhen]` marks a verb that can leave the page (`I tap`, the dialogs' `I choose`).
  `UatScenarioTestBase.RunExpectedBindFailureUatFile` checks a file that must fail binding.
- Todo sample: users (journey TOD.11). A Users page and a user edit page with one field of each
  kind a test drives (`RadioButton`, `CheckBox` + `DatePicker`, `Picker`, `Stepper`, a decimal
  `Entry`, `TimePicker`, `Switch`, `Slider`, `Editor`); users are managed by `Todo.Api`
  (`/api/users`, a validation problem per field, 409 for a taken name), cached in schema v3 and
  fetched first by a sync; the `team` test set. Unit, integration and contract tests only; the UI
  tests and UAT scenarios follow phrase namespaces.
- Callable phrases (AD-017): a tester names a sequence of steps under `## Phrase:` in a scenario
  file, or in `Scenarios/*.phrases.md` for every scenario, and calls it like a phrase. Its values
  are typed by the steps they go to (or an optional `Parameters` table), `<table>` / `<doc string>`
  pass the call's block on, and `## Phrase for each row:` runs the body once per row of the call's
  table. Calls are expanded and checked at bind time; a problem inside one is reported at the
  call with `via` lines to the body. No control flow, three levels deep at most, no shadowing.
  Broken callables (`UATC001`-`UATC008`) fail only their calls. The trace indents a call's steps,
  `brinell-data validate` checks phrase files and `phrases` lists callables with their types.
- Typed UAT arguments (AD-016): a phrase's `{name}` takes its type from the method parameter, and
  every step value, Examples cell and table cell is read by `BddValues` in one invariant format -
  dates `12-May-2026` (or `today`, `+2d`), numbers `1,250.75`, enums by name with spaces, lists
  `"A", "B" and "C"`. Values are checked when a step binds (`UATA001`-`UATA007`), before any app
  starts. Record and list parameters take the step's table (`Field | Value` for one record), a
  string parameter the phrase does not name takes a `"""` doc string (JSON for a record),
  `BddUserRole` is a user from the `Apps` table, and `[BddArgumentType]` / `IBddArgumentConverter<T>`
  add app types. `IBddClock` gives relative dates the fixture's now.
- Phrases from method names: an empty `[UatGiven]`/`[UatWhen]`/`[UatThen]` makes the method name the
  phrase, parameters in capitals (`I_open_the_todo_TITLE(string title)`).
- Broken phrases (`UATA010`-`UATA013`) no longer stop the catalog: the phrase is marked and only a
  step that binds to it fails.
- `brinell-data validate` checks scenario files too (parse, bind, arguments), `--fix` rewrites
  values with one right answer, `phrases` lists the phrases with argument types, and `snippet`
  writes a method for a step that binds to nothing.
- UAT subjects (AD-015): a step that starts with an app or user from the `Apps` table runs on
  that app, through a phrase declared with `{user}` first: `Daan taps Save` binds to
  `{user} taps {control}` on Daan's app, and the app stays current. Every built-in `I ...` control
  verb and page step has its `{user}` form; an app adds a second keyword attribute for its own.
  `{user}` is the acting user, and never a control verb's value. `Apps` gains the
  `User` and `Head` columns, and `AppsFile` in `Runtime` reads the table from a shared file.
  New bind errors `UATB005` (an app or user named like a page or control), `UATB006` (a subject
  that picks no app) and `UATB007` (an unknown `{user}`, or one in a suite without an `Apps`
  table).
- UAT mixed suites: `Head | mixed` runs only `@mixed` scenarios, and each app binds against its
  own head's pages (`IBddSessionHost.CompositionFor`, `BddCatalogSet`, AD-014). Each app keeps its
  own current page, and the result JSON records the app of every step.
- `TestAppDefinition`, `ITestApp` and `TestAppSet` (`Brinell.Core.Testing`): the apps of a
  fixture, started on first use, reset between tests, found by name or user, and captured
  together on a failure (`CaptureAll`, `ScreenshotTestAttribute.SetApps`). `IUatAppsHost` gives a
  UAT fixture its sessions from a set. `MarkdownTables` (`Brinell.Core.Utilities`) reads the
  tables of `uat.config.md` and `apps.md`.
- `TestComposition.ForFixture(fixture, options)` and `TestCompositionDiscoveryOptions.FromScans`:
  a composition of named modules, one per head.
- MAUI: `MauiTestContextOptions.Name` (the app's name in the call log) and
  `MauiDriverOptions.Placement`, a window placement for one launch; `BRINELL_AUT_PLACE` gains
  `left-half` and `right-half`.
- The Todo sample's mixed projects: `TestSupport.Apps` (`apps.md`, `TodoAppsFixture`,
  `TodoMauiDevice`), `Mixed.UITests` and `Mixed.Uat`: Windows, web and Android apps in one test.
- `[UatGiven]`, `[UatWhen]` and `[UatThen]` (`Brinell.Core.Testing`): the one way to declare a
  UAT step, on control methods, fixture methods and phrase-class methods alike (AD-011).
- Generated Html and Blazor controls: every Html and Blazor control is a `.tpl.cs` template and a
  generated `.gen.cs`, as on MAUI (`tools/Scripts/CreateHtml.Bat`). The Html capability bases
  implement the same Core interfaces as MAUI's (`IClickableControlObject`,
  `IFocusableControlObject`, `IToggleControlObject`, `IRangeControlObject`,
  `ISelectorControlObject`, `IEditableTextControlObject`, `ITextControlObject`), so the public
  surface matches and every built-in UAT phrase works on Html, `Enter` and `AssertSelectedText`
  included.
- Html `ContainerBase`: `IsExists`, `IsVisible`, `WaitExists`, `WaitVisible`, `AssertExists`,
  `AssertVisible`, as on MAUI containers. `CollectionObjectBase.WaitNoItemWhere`.
- `WebAppHost.FindBuiltApp`: the built assembly of a web app in the repository, for fixtures that
  start one.
- UAT heads: `Head` in `uat.config.md` and the `@maui` / `@web` tags. One scenario file runs on
  every head it is tagged for and is skipped on the others.
- UAT with several apps in one scenario: an `Apps` table in `uat.config.md`, `IBddSessionHost`
  on the fixture, and the built-in step `{app} uses the app`. A failure names the app.
- The Todo sample's UAT on the web head (`Brinell.Samples.Todo.Web.Uat`): the MAUI suite's
  scenario files, run through the web page objects, and a two-device scenario (Alice and Bob on
  one backend). The web detail page has a Back button, as the MAUI navigation bar does.
- Html on the call model (`.my/html/plan.md`): `Brinell.Html` owns its interfaces
  (`IHtmlElement` with `InstanceKey`, `IHtmlDriver`, `IHtmlElementScope`, `IHtmlPage`,
  `IHtmlTestContext`) and runs every control, page, container and row member as one call
  (`Brinell.Core.Calls`), with near-miss warnings and `BRINELL_CALL_LOG` (AD-009, AD-010).
- Html exceptions: `StaleElementException`, `ElementNotReadyException`,
  `ScopeNotReadyException`, `AppUnavailableException`, `RouteUnavailableException`. A closed
  browser is `AppUnavailableException` and ends the call at once.
- Html scope readiness: `ScopeReadiness`, the `data-busy` busy signal (`BusySignal`; Blazor
  pages require it, so a prerendered page is not acted on), `AppRoot`, `FrameScope<T>` for
  iframes, `ContainerBase.ProbeContentReadiness` and `AsksParent`.
- Html collections: `CollectionObjectBase`, `ItemObjectBase` and `ItemKey`. A row follows its
  item by `data-item-key`, and never acts on another.
- `ControlBase.ActAndConfirm`: Html actions that change state confirm their effect and are
  never repeated. `SetText`, `TypeText`, `Append`, `Clear`, `SetChecked`, `Toggle`,
  `SelectByValue`, `SelectByText`, `SelectByIndex`, `SetValue`, `Focus` and `Blur` use it.
- `Brinell.Html.Testing.WebAppHost`: starts a web app on a free port with explicit launch
  settings.
- The Todo sample's web head (`samples/Todo/src/Brinell.Samples.Todo.Web`) and its UI tests;
  `X-Todo-Client` (`TODO_CLIENT_ID`) and `Todo.Api`'s request log.
- `html-control` and `html-ui-test` skills.
- `Brinell.Maui.CommunityToolkit` control objects for CommunityToolkit.Maui: `Expander`,
  `AvatarView`, `RatingView`, `DrawingView`, `Popup`, `StateContainer` and `MediaElement`, each
  with a sample page section and Windows UI tests. Routes and platform gaps are in
  `docs/controls/community-toolkit.md`.
- Sample app `ToolkitVerbSink`: answers bridge verbs for toolkit views that AppSupport cannot know.
- Generator shortcuts: a component declares `protected bool? IsPlayingShortcut() =>
  PlayPauseButton.IsPlaying();` and gets the public trio as single calls on the part, with no
  second unit of work around it.
- Ordered comparisons `GreaterThan`, `AtLeast`, `LessThan`, `AtMost` for
  `[GenerateComparisons]`; `RangeControlBase.GetValue` declares all four
  (`WaitValueGreaterThan`, ...).
- `MediaPlayPauseButton` and `MediaTimeLabel` part controls; `MediaElement.Stop`,
  `WaitOpened`, `GetElapsed`, `GetRemaining` and their comparison variants.
- `Confirm(read, done, timeoutMs)` on `ViewBase` and `RootedScopeBase`: the one way a Core
  method waits for its action's effect. It never repeats the action, and returns a
  `Confirmation<T>` (`Confirmed`, `NotConfirmed`, `Replaced`) whose `Failure(...)` reports a
  replaced element as `StaleElementException`.
- MAUI's own interfaces: `IMauiElement` (with `InstanceKey`), `IMauiDriver`, `IMauiElementScope`,
  `IMauiPage`, `IMauiTestContext`, and `MauiElementExtensions` for the geometry and scope helpers
  (AD-010).
- MAUI exceptions: `StaleElementException`, `ElementNotReadyException` (`NotReadyReason`),
  `ScopeNotReadyException` (with `Readiness`), `AppUnavailableException`, raised by both drivers.
- Scope readiness: `ScopeReadiness` / `ScopeReadinessState`, `ProbeReadiness()` on every scope,
  `ProbeContentReadiness(root)` and `AsksParent` for containers.
- Collections: `ItemKey` on every row (`IMauiItemObject.Key`), `IItemStrategy.HasStableIds`,
  `timeoutMs` on `Item(int)`, `FindItem` and `ItemWhere`.
- Near-miss warnings: a call that passed after three or more replacements, or after using more
  than half its budget, logs `LogResult.Warning`. The thresholds are settings:
  `MauiTestContextOptions.NearMiss` (`NearMissSettings`), read through `IMauiTestContext.NearMiss`. `BRINELL_CALL_LOG` (a folder) makes
  `MauiTestContext` write every call to CSV.
- `tools/Scripts/repeat-run.ps1`: runs a test project N times and summarizes failures by test.
- AD-009 (app bugs stay failures) and AD-010 (MAUI ahead of Core, on purpose).
- Generator: `[AbsenceTolerant]` on a `Get*Core` reads once with the element resolved
  optionally (`RunGetWithOptionalElement`); `Is*Core` forwards extra parameters like `Get*Core`;
  state shortcuts may take parameters. The CLI prints a warning for a Core method that calls a
  `Run*` helper or a part's public member.
- `AvatarInitials` and `AvatarImage` part controls; `ContentDialog` gains `WaitTitle`,
  `AssertTitle`, `AssertButtonTexts` (sequence), `...HasItem`, `...Count`, `WaitMessage`,
  `AssertMessage`.

### Changed
- `PlaywrightTestContext.ResetAppState` clears the current origin's `localStorage` and
  `sessionStorage` as well as the cookies, so a value a page kept does not carry from one scenario
  to the next. The browser context stays, with its HTTP cache: a new context per scenario was
  tried and made Tomorrow's run a fifth slower, every script and font loaded cold.
- Html actions on Playwright leave visibility to Playwright's actionability wait instead of
  checking it first (one round trip fewer per action). A Playwright timeout before the action
  ran is `ElementNotReadyException` naming the control and Playwright's reason (not visible, not
  enabled, what intercepts pointer events), where it was a raw `System.TimeoutException`. A
  timeout after the action ran, while Playwright waited for the navigation it started, is the
  action done and is not repeated.
- An Html page's readiness probe is one round trip on Playwright: `IHtmlPageProbe.ProbePage` reads
  `document.readyState` and the body's `data-busy` in one evaluation, and `HtmlPageObjectBase`
  uses it when its context answers it. A page is loaded when its URL matches and the document is
  `complete`; the browser's network idle (a 10 ms wait that threw while a page loaded) is no
  longer asked. Contexts without the probe (bUnit's, mocks) read idle and the body as before.
- The poll's pause between attempts (`WaitHelper.Pause`) blocks with `Thread.Sleep` instead of
  spinning, so parallel collections no longer keep a core busy each between attempts.
- Gesture bridge targets may share an `AutomationId` (`.docs/contracts/bridge.md`).
  `BrinellUiaBridge.Register` adds instead of replacing; the host withdraws an element's own
  target before re-publishing it. A new meta verb `GetBounds` (4) is answered for every target,
  and `IBrinellVerbTarget.TryGetScreenBounds` is required. The FlaUI client picks the target
  nearest the real element when several match.
- Presenter runs a suite in a runner process of its own (AD-025): `Brinell.Uat.dll` has an entry
  point and is started in the suite's output with the suite's `runtimeconfig.json` and `deps.json`,
  so a scenario runs from Presenter as under `dotnet test`. Presenter drives it a step at a time
  over a named pipe (`Brinell.Bdd.Runner`); the runner paces and records. The process ends with
  the run: Presenter no longer grows with every run of a suite with a mock server or a database,
  and the suite can be rebuilt while Presenter is open. `AssemblyFile.Record` and `PathOf` are gone.
- **Breaking: `Uat` names are only for `Brinell.Uat`.** Bdd is the main and Uat a specialization
  of it (AD-021), so everything outside `Brinell.Uat` takes `Bdd` names. No old names are kept.
  - The 111 `Uat*` types of `Brinell.Bdd` and `Brinell.Core` are `Bdd*`: `BddBinder`,
    `BddCatalogSet`, `BddMarkdownParser`, `IBddClock`, `BddEffectiveStepKeyword`,
    `[BddIgnore]`, `[BddArgumentType]` and the rest. So are the Presenter's types and the Todo
    sample's orderer.
  - The run address trait is `BddScenario=<file>#<slug>`.
  - The tool projects are `Brinell.Bdd.Workspace`, `Brinell.Bdd.Preview`,
    `Brinell.Bdd.LanguageServer`, `Brinell.Bdd.VisualStudio` (and `.CodeLens`) and
    `Brinell.Bdd.VsCode`, and their types are `Bdd*`. The test project
    `Brinell.Presenter.Uat.Tests` is `Brinell.Presenter.Bdd.Tests`.
  - The IDE extensions are "Brinell BDD", with new identities, so uninstall the old ones: the
    BDD Explorer, **Toggle BDD Step Breakpoint**, `brinellBdd.*` settings, the MCP server
    `brinell-bdd`, and `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Brinell\bdd-breakpoints.json`.
  - `UatPlatformsAttribute` keeps its name for now.
- The feature-file engine is its own package, `Brinell.Bdd`: parser and models, values, argument
  types, tables, the catalog and binder, callable steps, namespaces, config, execution and runner,
  the step-definition runtime, `[BddStepDefinitions]`, `BddStepDefinitionsBase`, `[BddIgnore]`,
  `IBddClock` and `IBddSessionHost`, in the namespace `Brinell.Bdd`. `Brinell.Uat` depends on it and
  keeps pages, controls, page scope (behind `IStepScopeModel` / `IStepScope` on the catalog's
  `Scope`), apps, name inference and the UAT test base. A project that uses `Brinell.Uat` types adds
  `using Brinell.Bdd;` (or `<Using Include="Brinell.Bdd" />`). Type names are unchanged.
- The folder of feature and step files is `Features/`, not `Scenarios/`: the default of
  `BddScenarioSource`, `UatScenarioTestBase`, `UatSpecFormatTestBase` and the tools. The files stay in
  the projects that own them. `brinell-data validate` reports an old `Scenarios/` folder beside the
  config as `UAT029`, and `--fix` renames it.
- Feature and step files use the BDD words (D5 of the Bdd plan), with no period where both are
  read: `*.uat.md` is `*.feature.md` with `# Feature:`, `*.phrases.md` is `*.steps.md` with
  `# Steps:`, and `## Phrase:` / `## Phrase for each row:` are `## Step:` / `## Step for each row:`.
  An old heading or file name is `UAT029`; `brinell-data validate --fix` renames the file and
  rewrites its headings. A service suite's config is `bdd.config.md`; `uat.config.md` stays for
  UI suites, and the tools read either.
- Step attributes use the BDD words (D3 of the Bdd plan), with no aliases: `[UatGiven]`/`[UatWhen]`/
  `[UatThen]` are `[BddGiven]`/`[BddWhen]`/`[BddThen]`, `UatPhraseAttribute` is `BddStepAttribute`,
  `[UatPhraseClass]` is `[BddStepDefinitions]`, `UatPhraseClassBase` is `BddStepDefinitionsBase` and
  `[UatNamespace]` is `[BddNamespace]`, all still in `Brinell.Core.Testing`. `[UatNavigatesTo]` keeps
  its name. The guide `uat-phrases-and-flows.md` is now `uat-step-definitions.md`, beside a new
  `bdd-glossary.md`.
- `BddTableBinding` reads cells with `BddValues`: table dates are written `12-May-2026`, not
  `2026-05-12`, and failure tables print values that way. A phrase method with a `CommandId` is a
  broken phrase instead of a catalog exception; `UatDiscovery` reports it as a warning.
- `UatPhraseAttribute` is abstract, lives in `Brinell.Core.Testing`, has a non-null `Keyword`
  and carries `CommandId`, `Literal` and `HasLiteral`. A phrase method that sets any of those
  three fails discovery with an error naming the method (`UATD004` in `UatDiscovery`).
  `UatCommandBinding.Keyword` and `BddPhraseMethodPhrase.Keyword` are non-null.
- **Breaking:** Html's `ControlBase` `Run*` helpers have MAUI's names and signatures (R8):
  `RunWaitWithElement` and `RunWaitWithOptionalElement` take `expected` first, and
  `RunGetWithOptionalElement` is new. `RunWithElement` and `RunAssert(Action<IHtmlElement>)` are
  gone; use `RunGetWithElement`, `RunDoWithElement` and `RunAssertWithElement`.
- **Breaking:** Html and Blazor control members follow the generated names: `LabelControl`'s
  `AssertTextContaining` and `IsTextContaining` are `AssertTextContains` and `WaitTextContains`;
  `LinkControl.Href` is `GetHref()`; `ListControl.ItemCount` and `TableControl.RowCount` /
  `ColumnCount` are `GetItemCount()`, `GetRowCount()`, `GetColumnCount()`; `RangeControlBase` reads
  and sets `double?` (`GetValue`, `SetValue`, `GetMinimum`, `GetMaximum`, `GetStep`, `Increment`,
  `Decrement`); date and time inputs read and set `DateOnly?` / `TimeOnly?` (`GetDate`,
  `SetDate`, `GetMinimum`, ...); `TextAreaControl.AppendText` is `Append`; `SelectMultiple` takes
  an array; `IFrameControl.ElementExistsInside` is `IsElementInside`; `NavMenuControl.HasItem`
  and `AssertHasItem` are `WaitItemsHasItem` and `AssertItemsHasItem`. `ToggleControlBase.Check`
  and `Uncheck` do nothing when the box is already in that state, as on MAUI.
- The Html and Blazor UAT fixtures start the Blazor sample with `WebAppHost`; `HtmlSampleHost`
  and `BlazorSampleHost` are gone.
- `TodoDataPhrases` moved to `Brinell.Samples.Todo.TestSupport.Uat`, over `ITodoArrangement`, so
  both heads' UAT suites share it. The Todo web fixture runs devices (`TodoWebDevice`) on one
  fake backend, and can restart and change test set.
- **Breaking:** the calls layer, its exceptions and scope readiness moved from `Brinell.Maui`
  and `Brinell.Html` into Core, one copy for both stacks (AD-010,
  `.my/core/review-what-can-move-now.md`). `Brinell.Maui.Calls`, `Brinell.Html.Calls`,
  `Brinell.Maui.Exceptions`, `Brinell.Html.Exceptions` and `Brinell.Maui.Scopes` are gone:
  - `Brinell.Core.Calls`: `Confirmation<T>`, `ConfirmationResult` (was
    `Brinell.Maui.Controls.Base`), `CallBudget`, `NearMissSettings` (was
    `Brinell.Maui.Context` / `Brinell.Html.Context`); the internal call types.
  - `Brinell.Core.Exceptions`: `StaleElementException`, `ElementNotReadyException`,
    `NotReadyReason`, `ScopeNotReadyException`, `AppUnavailableException`,
    `RouteUnavailableException`. One type across stacks: a catch works for either.
  - `Brinell.Core.Scopes`: `ScopeReadiness` (with `RootReacquired`, on both stacks now),
    `ScopeReadinessState`. Html's `BusySignal` stays in `Brinell.Html.Scopes`.
- The merged calls layer is the union of both copies. MAUI gains the confirmation's own
  budget context and the cut-off rule for a driver timeout after the deadline; Html gains
  `ItemChanged`, the scroll-to-find throttle and the poll's `stop`. `ControlCall` takes the
  logger, test name and near-miss settings instead of a stack's context (MAUI still logs
  "Test": `IMauiTestContext` has no name yet). `AttemptContext.RemainingOr` is replaced by `CallBudget.RemainingOr`,
  which never answers less than 1 ms inside a call.
- `StaleElementException`'s message is platform-neutral: "is no longer there: it was removed
  or replaced".
- `CommunityToolkit.Maui` 9.0.0 -> 15.0.1 and `Microsoft.Maui.Controls` -> 10.0.90 (required by the
  toolkit). Added `CommunityToolkit.Maui.MediaElement` 10.0.0.
- `Brinell.Maui.CommunityToolkit` no longer references CommunityToolkit.Maui, is centrally
  versioned, and is in `srcnew/Brinell.sln`. `CreateMaui.Bat` generates its controls too.
- `MediaElement<TScope>` moved from `Brinell.Maui.Controls.Media` to
  `Brinell.Maui.CommunityToolkit.Controls.Media`.
- `MediaElement` forwards to its parts instead of polling around them: `SetPlaying` returns
  the media element rather than the page; `WaitProgressPasses` is replaced by
  `WaitProgressGreaterThan`, and `WaitDurationKnown` by `WaitOpened`.
- Every control now does one unit of work per call. `ToggleControlBase`, `Stepper`,
  `CarouselView`, `Expander`, `RatingView`, `DrawingView` and `MediaPlayPauseButton` confirm their
  effect with `Confirm` instead of a nested poll; a timeout carries the last read's error as
  `InnerException`.
- **MAUI calls (AD-004, AD-009; `.my/stale-readiness/`):** every public call on a control,
  page, container, collection or row is one log entry/exit pair and one budget. Only the call's
  poll waits, and each attempt first asks the scope chain (row, collection, page), then finds
  the element again. Actions resolve by polling, then act once. A Core method that throws
  `ElementNotReadyException` has not acted, so it is asked again within the budget.
- MAUI no longer implements Core's `IElement`, `IDriver`, `IElementScope`, `IPageObject`,
  `ITestContext<T>`, `IContainerControl` or `IContainerObject`, and controls no longer derive
  from `ControlObjectBase`. Core itself is unchanged.
- Finds on MAUI elements, drivers and scopes make one attempt; the timeout overloads are gone.
- `IsLoaded()`, `GetTitle()` and `TakeScreenshot(string?)` lose their unused timeouts.
- `ItemContainerBase` is `ItemObjectBase`, and `IMauiItemContainer` is `IMauiItemObject`.
- MAUI throws `ScopeNotReadyException` where it threw `PageLoadException`, and
  `ElementNotReadyException` where a disabled or hidden control used to raise `TimeoutException`.
  The FlaUI driver reports a disabled toolbar or menu item, or one no bridge target answered
  for, as `ElementNotReadyException`.
- `Item(int)`, `this[int]`, `SelectItem` and `ItemWhere` wait within their budget; `TryItem`,
  `TrySelectItem` and `FindItem` answer about now. `ScrollToItem`, `ScrollToEnd`, `ScrollToTop`
  and `WaitForItems` run on one budget (`DefaultWait` unless given), and a long list needs a
  budget to match.
- A row is found again by its item key, and reports `ItemChanged` instead of answering for
  another item. This covers a row's own members (`Click`, `GetText`) as well as the controls inside
  it: a cached row element that now holds another item is not used.
- `SelectItem` finds the row by polling, then activates it once. Only an activation that reports
  "nothing activated" is asked again; any exception ends the call.
- `IMauiElement.ScrollIntoView(int timeoutMs)` has no default. Every scroll inside a call gets what
  is left of the call's budget (`CallRemainingMs` on controls and scopes), and Appium's Android
  scroll makes at least one step. `ScrollHelper.ScrollIntoView` takes a budget, and
  `ScrollView.ScrollTo` is one call.
- A call whose attempts all raised an unexpected exception fails with `WaitTimeoutException`,
  naming the exception type and how many attempts raised it, with the exception as
  `InnerException`. A single attempt still throws the exception itself.
- A route the platform does not have ends the call at once as `RouteUnavailableException` instead
  of being asked again until the budget runs out: the `IMauiElement` and `IMauiDriver` capability
  defaults, a bridge-declared element asked for something that lives in the UI Automation tree, and
  a locator strategy that cannot be matched against an element already in hand. A bridge verb the
  app did not answer is not a missing route and is still retried.
- `Assert*` members that read through an element find the element again and re-check visibility on
  every attempt, as `Get*` members already did. They used to resolve once and hold it, so an
  element replaced while still alive was compared until the budget ran out.
- `AppRoot.WaitReady(timeoutMs)` polls its own readiness on the budget given; it used to ask the
  context, which answered "not disposed" without waiting and ignored the timeout.
- The FlaUI driver raises `AppUnavailableException` when a bridge verb, a state read or a gesture
  found no target because the launched app has exited, instead of "not ready" or "unavailable".
- `IMauiElementScope.DescribeMiss(locator)` builds a scope's "not found" message without
  looking again; a control's `NotFound()` uses it.
- `IsExists()` / `IsVisible()` on containers and pages answer now and take no timeout;
  `GetItemCount()`, `IsEmpty()` and `TrySelectItem(index)` lose their unused timeouts.
- `AppRoot` no longer scrolls to look for a control; Shell's flyout still does, within itself.
- `IsExists()` / `IsVisible()` on a control read the element only; they no longer consult the
  page.
- `IItemRootProvider`: `KeyOf(root, position)` and `TryGetItemRoot(ItemKey)`.
- `AvatarView`: the `Text` part is now `Initials` (`AvatarInitials`), and `GetText` /
  `WaitText` / `AssertText` are `GetInitials` / `WaitInitials` / `AssertInitials`. `Image` is an
  `AvatarImage`.
- `StateContainer`: `IsShowing` / `WaitShowing` / `AssertShowing` take a view id only (the
  `Locator` overloads are gone) and are generated; `WaitShowing`'s `expected` is `bool?`.
- `ContentDialog` is a generated template; `GetTitle` and friends take an optional `timeoutMs`,
  and `GetButtonTexts` returns `IReadOnlyList<string>?`.
- `Popup.CloseWith` is hand-written as two calls in sequence; same signature.
- `WebView.GetUrl` / `GetPageTitle` lose an `[AbsenceTolerant]` that had no effect, so their
  behaviour stays as it was now that the attribute works on getters.
- Migrated from Oravey.UITestFramework namespace

### Removed
- `UatStepAttribute`, the writable `[UatPhrase(keyword, phrase)]` and the `[UatPhrase(phrase)]`
  form without a keyword. Use `[UatGiven]`, `[UatWhen]` or `[UatThen]`.
- **Breaking:** Html's async members: `Brinell.Html.Interfaces.Async` (`IAsyncHtmlElement`,
  `IHtmlAsyncControlObject` and the capability interfaces), `HtmlAsyncExtensions`,
  `ControlBase.RunWithElementAsync`, `HtmlPageObjectBase.WaitLoadedAsync` and the other `*Async`
  page, container and context wrappers. They wrapped the synchronous calls and added nothing;
  every member is one synchronous call, as on MAUI.
- Html's `Control<TScope>` and `List<TScope>`: use `ClickableControlBase` and `ListControl`.
- Html: `RunDoWithElement` no longer retries an action that threw (X2). `ObjectBase.Poll`,
  `ControlBase.RunPoll`, the element finds with a timeout, `PlaywrightTestContext.ForFrame`
  and `BlazorTestContext.WaitForBlazorReady` are gone. `IsLoaded()`, `GetTitle()` and
  `TakeScreenshot(string?)` on Html pages lost their unused timeouts. Html no longer throws
  `PageLoadException`.
- MAUI: `DriverRootScope` (use `AppRoot`), `Popup.Page => null`, `CanResolveElements`,
  `CreateScopeNotReadyException`, `IsParentReady` / `WaitParentReady`, `WaitContentReady` /
  `WaitContentReadyCore` (use `ProbeContentReadiness`), `IsReady(int?)` (now `IsReady()`), the
  page's `EnsureLoaded`, both `Until` implementations (use `Confirm`), `RunPoll`,
  `WaitVisibleCore`, `EnsureVisible(element, timeout)` and `doEnsureVisible`, and the virtual
  `ViewBase.FindElement()` (override `TryFindElement()` and `NotFound()`), and
  `ObjectBase.Poll`.
- `FlaUIMauiDriver.SupportsStateReads`: `ReadState` answers in one bridge walk.
- `PageReadinessSnapshot` from the MAUI page contract.

### Fixed
- Html: `Locator.ByAccessibilityId` finds by the accessible name (`aria-label`, `aria-labelledby`
  or a `<label>`, exactly), where it looked for a generic role with that name and found nothing;
  attribute and text selectors escape a backslash as well as a quote.
- Html: `CollectionObjectBase.Item(key)` and `TryItem(key)` read every row's `data-item-key` in
  turn, a driver call per row, so on a long list one attempt outlasted the call's budget and the
  item was never found. They look the row up once by its key's selector now; such a row's
  `Position` is `-1`.
- Html: a read of an element that a re-render removed waited out the rest of the call, so one
  read ended the poll (R2). Playwright reads now wait for their element at most
  `PlaywrightHtmlElement.ReadAttachMs` and report a node that is gone as stale.
- Html: a keyed row was found again by position, so after a re-render it read another item's row
  and answered for the wrong item. It is found by its `data-item-key` now.
- Html: `CollectionObjectBase`'s "no row matches" failure names what the wait last saw.
- `Brinell.Maui.UITests`' `NavigationDemoPage` looked up by name through an XPath locator the
  FlaUI driver does not support, so its "unreachable by name" probes never looked.
- `AndroidRecorder` stopped every `screenrecord` on the device (`pkill screenrecord`) and failed when
  one belonged to another user; it stops only its own now. It also pulled the video into the
  results folder directly, which adb cannot do past Windows' 260 characters; it pulls into the
  temp folder and moves the file.
- CI: a deterministic build mapped PDB paths to `/_/`, and the language server failed on them
  ("Invalid URI"); `BddSourceLocator` gives no location for them, and tests and samples keep real
  paths. A cancel that reached the BDD runner before its step started was lost.
