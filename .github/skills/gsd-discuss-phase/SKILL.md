# /gsd-discuss-phase

Gather implementation decisions through adaptive questioning before planning. Produces CONTEXT.md that downstream agents (researcher, planner) use to know what to investigate and what choices are locked.

**This skill does NOT delegate to a sub-agent.** It drives the questioning flow itself.

## Invocation

```
/gsd-discuss-phase <phase-number>
```

- Phase number is required
- `$ARGUMENTS` contains the phase number

## Process

### Step 1: Parse Arguments

Extract phase number from `$ARGUMENTS`. Error if missing.

### Step 2: Validate Phase Exists

```
Call gsd_find_phase with the phase number.
```

If phase not found:
```
Phase [X] not found in roadmap.
Use /gsd-progress to see available phases.
```
Stop.

### Step 3: Check Existing Context

If CONTEXT.md already exists in the phase directory, use `manage_todo_list` to ask:
- **Update it** — Review and revise existing context
- **View it** — Show what's there, then offer update/skip
- **Skip** — Use existing context as-is (exit)

If no CONTEXT.md but plans already exist, warn the user:
> Phase [X] already has [N] plan(s) created without user context. Your decisions here won't affect existing plans unless you replan.

Offer: "Continue and replan after" / "View existing plans" / "Cancel"

### Step 4: Load Phase Context

Call `gsd_roadmap_get_phase` for the phase number. Extract:
- Phase name and goal
- Phase boundary (what it delivers)
- Dependencies
- Success criteria

### Step 5: Analyze Domain and Generate Gray Areas

Based on the phase goal, determine what kind of thing is being built and identify 3-4 **phase-specific** gray areas (not generic categories).

**Domain heuristics:**
- Something users **SEE** → layout, density, interactions, empty states, responsive behavior
- Something users **CALL** → response format, pagination, error handling, caching, auth
- Something users **RUN** → output format, flags, modes, error handling, progress
- Something users **READ** → structure, tone, depth, flow, navigation
- Something being **ORGANIZED** → criteria, grouping, naming, exceptions

**Generate concrete gray areas, not abstract labels:**
```
Phase: "User authentication"
→ Session handling, Error responses, Multi-device policy, Recovery flow

Phase: "CLI for database backups"
→ Output format, Flag design, Progress reporting, Error recovery
```

**Key question:** What decisions would change the outcome that the user should weigh in on?

**Do NOT ask about** (Claude handles these):
- Technical implementation details
- Architecture patterns
- Performance optimization
- Scope (roadmap defines this)

### Step 6: Present Gray Areas

State the domain boundary first:
```
Phase [X]: [Name]
Domain: [What this phase delivers]

We'll clarify HOW to implement this.
(New capabilities belong in other phases.)
```

Then present gray areas as a multi-select list. Each option has a concrete label and 1-2 questions it covers. **No "skip" or "you decide" option** — user ran this command to discuss.

### Step 7: Deep-Dive Each Selected Area

For each selected area:

1. **Announce the area:** "Let's talk about [Area]."
2. **Ask 4 targeted questions** — each with 2-3 concrete options plus "You decide" where reasonable
3. **After 4 questions, check:** "More questions about [area], or move to next?"
   - If "More" → ask 4 more, check again
   - If "Next" → proceed to next selected area
4. **Record each answer as a locked decision**

After all initially-selected areas complete:
- Summarize what was captured
- Ask: "We've discussed [list]. Which gray areas remain unclear?"
- Options: "Explore more gray areas" / "I'm ready for context"
- If "Explore more" → identify 2-4 additional areas, loop back

**Scope creep handling:** If user mentions something outside the phase domain:
> "[Feature] sounds like a new capability — that belongs in its own phase. I'll note it as a deferred idea. Back to [current area]..."

Track deferred ideas internally.

### Step 8: Write CONTEXT.md

Create the file using the `gsd_scaffold` MCP tool, then fill in the content:

1. Call `gsd_scaffold` with `type: "context"` and `phase: {phase_num}` — this creates `{phase_dir}/{padded_phase}-CONTEXT.md` with correct YAML frontmatter
2. Edit the scaffolded file to add the full content based on the template at `.github/skills/gsd-discuss-phase/templates/context.md`

Include:
- Phase boundary from ROADMAP.md (fixed, not negotiable)
- All locked decisions organized by discussed area
- Claude's Discretion section (areas where user said "you decide")
- Specific Ideas (references, "I want it like X" moments)
- Deferred Ideas (scope creep captured but not acted on)

### Step 9: Commit

```
Call gsd_commit with message: "docs({phase_num}): gather phase context"
Include the CONTEXT.md file.
```

### Step 10: Suggest Next Steps

```
## ▶ Next Up

**Phase [N]: [Name]** — [Goal from ROADMAP.md]

`/gsd-research-phase [N]` — research domain before planning
`/gsd-plan-phase [N]` — skip research, plan directly
```

## Key Principles

- **User = visionary, Claude = builder.** Ask about vision and preferences, not technical details.
- **Phase boundary is FIXED.** Discussion clarifies HOW, not WHETHER to add more.
- **Decisions must be specific.** "Card-based layout with author, timestamp, content" not "some kind of layout."
- **Downstream awareness:** CONTEXT.md feeds researcher (what to investigate) and planner (what's locked).
