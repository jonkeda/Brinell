# Research Template

Template for `.planning/phases/XX-name/{phase_num}-RESEARCH.md`.

**Purpose:** Document what needs to be known to implement a phase well — standard approaches, pitfalls, and verified patterns.

# Phase [X]: [Name] - Research

**Researched:** [date]
**Domain:** [primary technology/problem domain]
**Confidence:** [HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW]

<user_constraints>
## User Constraints (from CONTEXT.md)

**CRITICAL:** If CONTEXT.md exists, copy locked decisions here verbatim. These MUST be honored by the planner.

### Locked Decisions
[Copy from CONTEXT.md `## Decisions` section — NON-NEGOTIABLE]
- [Decision 1]
- [Decision 2]

### Claude's Discretion
[Copy from CONTEXT.md — areas where researcher/planner can choose]
- [Area 1]

### Deferred Ideas (OUT OF SCOPE)
[Copy from CONTEXT.md — do NOT research or plan these]
- [Deferred 1]

**If no CONTEXT.md exists:** Write "No user constraints — all decisions at Claude's discretion"
</user_constraints>

<research_summary>
## Summary

[2-3 paragraph executive summary]
- What was researched
- What the standard approach is
- Key recommendations

**Primary recommendation:** [one-liner actionable guidance]
