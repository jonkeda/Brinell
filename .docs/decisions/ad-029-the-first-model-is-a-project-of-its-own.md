# AD-029: The First Model Is A Project Of Its Own

`Bruinet.Core` describes the call model alone. The interfaces and waits of Bruinet's first model,
where every lookup waits on a budget of its own, are `Bruinet.Core.Legacy`, which only the WPF,
WinForms and Stride stacks reference: `IDriver`, `IElement`, `IElementScope`, `IPageObject`,
`IContainerControl`, `IContainerObject`, `IPagedScope`, `IRangePatternElement`, the generic
`ITestContext<T>`, `PageReadinessSnapshot`, the old `ControlObjectBase`, the geometry over
`IElement`, and `LegacyWaitHelper` (once `WaitHelper.WaitFor`). The namespaces did not change,
so those stacks only gained a reference.

What stays in Core because the call-model stacks use it: the non-generic `ITestContext` (every
stack's context implements it), `BusySignalPolicy` (MAUI's pages), `IDiagnosticDriver`,
`ElementGeometryExtensions.CenterOf`, `WaitHelper.Pause`, and the control-object interfaces.
A wait below a call is `Bruinet.Core.Calls.Settle.Until`: one confirmation, bounded by the
running call (`CallBudget.Within`). Composition and UAT still find a first-model page, by the
interface's name (`TestPages.IsFirstModelPage`), so neither references the old project.

**Why:** Html, MAUI and native Android derive from none of the first model (AD-010), yet Core's
public surface was mostly that model, and a reader of `IDriver` learned the opposite of the
call-model contract (the [review of 2026-10-21](https://github.com/exact-mobile-apps/test-tooling/blob/37f180a7/.my/reviews/2026-10-21-review.md)). The
project earns its place by AD-026's R4: a layer the old stacks build on and the call-model stacks
build without.

**Ruled out:**
- marking the interfaces `[Obsolete]` in Core: the old stacks would build with warnings
  everywhere, and Core would still describe two models;
- moving WPF, WinForms and Stride onto the call model first: a topic of its own, which nobody
  has asked for, and this split does not wait on it.

**Broken when:** a call-model project (Html, Blazor, MAUI and its heads, native Android, Appium,
UAT, Bdd) references `Bruinet.Core.Legacy` (`SolutionTests.NoCallModelStack_ReferencesTheFirstModel`);
a first-model type is added to Core again; or a call-model stack waits with `LegacyWaitHelper`.
