# .docs

The durable layer to read **before changing Bruinet**: decisions, invariants and
contracts - what must stay true. Not a description of the code; that can be regenerated
from the source and goes stale. The reasoning: [the documentation plan](https://github.com/exact-mobile-apps/test-tooling/blob/fe5d2b66/.my/documentation/plan.md).

How this differs from the other trees:

| Tree | Holds | Reader |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **`.docs/`** | decisions, invariants, contracts: what must stay true | someone **changing** Bruinet |
| `docs/` | getting started, guides, control catalogue, how to run | someone **using** Bruinet |
| `.my/` | plans, analyses, reviews for work in flight | whoever is doing that work |
| `docs2/` | archive | nobody, until needed |

## Contracts

- [Call model](contracts/call-model.md) - one call, one budget, one log pair (R0-R9); MAUI, Html and native Android.
- [Control object](contracts/control-object.md) - the `.tpl.cs` / `.gen.cs` contract,
  act-once and `Confirm`.
- [Bridge](contracts/bridge.md) - `GestureAutomation.Verbs`: what an app must publish.
- [Apps in a test](contracts/uat-apps-host.md) - `TestAppSet` and `IUatAppsHost`: one table of apps, started
  lazily, evidence from every started app.
